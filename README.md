TravelTales-FullStack

TravelTales is a full-stack web application designed to help users explore and manage global travel destinations. This project uses a React frontend with Bootstrap for a responsive UI. The backend is built using .NET with ADO.NET for efficient data handling, and a SQL database is used for storing destination-related information.
